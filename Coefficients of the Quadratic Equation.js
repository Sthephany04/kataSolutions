// In this Kata you are expected to find the coefficients of quadratic equation of the given two roots (x1 and x2). (x-x1) * (x-x2) = 0. This means (x-1) * (x-2) = 0; when we do the multiplication this becomes x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0

const quadratic = (x1, x2) => {
  let terminoA = 1;
  let terminoB = ((-x2) + (-x1));
  let terminoC = ((-x2) * (-x1));
  let array = [terminoA, terminoB, terminoC];
  return array;
